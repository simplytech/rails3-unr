Ruby on Rails - Up and Running
  (by Bruce A. Tate & Curt Hibbs)
  (Publisher: O'REILLY)
  
This book assumes an older version of Rails, but since I like to use Rails 3,
I am committing a step-by-step walk-through of the book, with any modifications
that are needed for the examples to work in Rails 3.

I hope it makes learning Rails 3 easier for anyone who has this book, but has
struggled to make the examples work in Rails 3.
